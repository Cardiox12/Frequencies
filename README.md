# Frequencies

Frequencies is a utility that allows you to search for airport frequencies by OACI code.\
Style and components are made by me, see [SCADA Components](https://replit.com/@Cardiox12/SCADA-Components) for further details.\
Frequencies is made with PySide2 and fbs, release is coming soon.
